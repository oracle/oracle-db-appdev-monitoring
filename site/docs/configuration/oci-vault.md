# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Vault

Securely load database credentials from OCI Vault.

Each database in the config file may be configured to use OCI Vault. To load the database username and/or password from OCI Vault, set the `vault.oci` property to contain the OCI Vault OCID, and secret names for the database username/password:

```yaml
databases:
  mydb:
    vault:
      oci:
        id: <VAULT OCID>
        usernameSecret: <Secret containing DB username>
        passwordSecret: <Secret containing DB password>
```

The exporter uses the OCI Go SDK default configuration provider for OCI Vault access. Ensure the process is running with OCI SDK configuration or instance metadata access that can read the configured vault and secrets.
