## Release Notes

### Unreleased

Our current priorities are support for RAC and mutliple databases (including #84 and #89).  We expect to address these in an upcoming release.


### Version 1.5.5, March 13, 2025

This release includes the following changes:

- [@VictorErmakov](https://github.com/VictorErmakov) updated the docker-compose sample with connection pool parameters to avoid fast connect cycling (#191).  
- Update default values for connection pool parameters to use go-sql pooling by default to avoid fast connet cycling.
- Updated some third-party dependencies.

### Version 1.5.4, March 3, 2025

This release includes the following changes:

- Based of this recommendation from [godror](https://github.com/godror/godror?tab=readme-ov-file#pooling), which relates to the two following items, and in discussion with the ODPI-C team, we have introduced additional parameters to allow you to set connection pool parameters, and have set defaults which will avoid fast connect cycling.  It is our expectation that a fix may be produced in the underlying ODPI-C library for the underlying issue.  In the mean time, these changes will avoid the conditions under which the error can occur.
- Fix malloc error (#177, #181).
- Fix intermittent connection issues with ADB-S when exporter is run in a container (#169).
- Fix Multiple custom metrics files overwrite one another (#179).
- Replace go-kit/log with log/slog, due to upstream changes in prometheus/common.
- Add support for additional admin roles, expanding list of options for `DB_ROLE` to `SYSDBA`, `SYSOPER`, `SYSBACKUP`, `SYSDG`, `SYSKM`, `SYSRAC` and `SYSASM` (#180).
- Updated some third-party dependencies.

In this release, we also continued some minor code refactoring.

### Version 1.5.3, January 28, 2025

*Known issue*: This release has a known issue that results in the error message `malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted`.
We recommend staying on 1.5.2 until a new release with a fix is available.  We hope to have a fix by early March.

This release includes the following changes:

- Fix over-zealous supression of errors when `ignorezeroresult = true` (#168).
- When `scrapeinterval` is set, do first scrape immediately, not after the interval (#166).
- Updated some third-party dependencies.

### Version 1.1.1, November 28, 2023

This release just updates some third-party dependencies.

### Version 1.1, October 27, 2023

This release includes the following changes:

- The query for the standard metric `wait_class` has been updated so that it will work in both container databases
  and pluggable databases, including in Oracle Autonomous Database instances.  Note that this query will not return
  any data unless the database instance is under load.
- Support for reading the database password from OCI Vault has been added (see [details](#using-oci-vault))
- Log messages have been improved
- Some dependencies have been updated

### Version 1.0, September 13, 2023

The first production release, v1.0, includes the following features:

- A number of [standard metrics](#standard-metrics) are exposed,
- Users can define [custom metrics](#custom-metrics),
- Oracle regularly reviews third-party licenses and scans the code and images, including transitive/recursive dependencies for issues,
- Connection to Oracle can be a basic connection or use an Oracle Wallet and TLS - connection to Oracle Autonomous Database is supported,
- Metrics for Oracle Transactional Event Queues are also supported,
- A Grafana dashboard is provided for Transactional Event Queues, and
- A pre-built container image is provided, based on Oracle Linux, and optimized for size and security.

Note that this exporter uses a different Oracle Database driver which in turn uses code directly written by Oracle to access the database.  This driver does require an Oracle client.  In this initial release, the client is bundled into the container image, however we intend to make that optional in order to minimize the image size.

The interfaces for this version have been kept as close as possible to those of earlier alpha releases in this repository to assist with migration.  However, it should be expected that there may be breaking changes in future releases.
