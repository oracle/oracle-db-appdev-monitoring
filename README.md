# Unified Observability with Oracle Database

This distribution contains scripts and code for exporting metrics, logs, and traces from any Oracle Database to provide converged observability for data-centric applications. 

Metrics from the application layer, Kubernetes, and Oracle Database can be combined to provide unified observability to developers within a single Grafana console. 

All three exporters (metrics, log, and trace) can be configured in the same file and each is explained in the corresponding doc pages:


[Metrics Exporter][Metrics Exporter]

[Log Exporter][Log Exporter]

[Trace Exporter][Trace Exporter]

The old version of the metrics exporter can be found in the [old implementation branch][old implementation branch] and the new metrics exporter implementation is backward compatible such that the same configuration for both database connection and metrics definition can be used.

Users are encouraged to open issues and enhancements requests against this repos and feel free to ask any questions.  We will actively work on them as we will the development of the exporters.

### Build

Build without running tests using the following.

`mvn clean package -DskipTests`

Tests use a live database and require `DATA_SOURCE_NAME` environment variable be set (see section on Running) and can be run using the following.

`mvn clean package`

Docker image can be build using the following.

`./build.sh`

Docker image can be pushed to $DOCKER_REGISTRY using the following.

`./push.sh`

### Run

Ensure the environment variable DATA_SOURCE_NAME (and TNS_ADMIN if appropriate) is set correctly before starting.

For Example:

```bash
export DATA_SOURCE_NAME="%USER%/$(dbpassword)@%PDB_NAME%_tp"
```

Kubernetes Secrets, etc. an of course be used to store password.

OCI Vault support for storing/accessing password values is built into exporters and is enabled by simply setting the OCI_REGION and VAULT_SECRET_OCID variables.

For Example:

```bash
export OCI_REGION="us-ashburn-1"
export VAULT_SECRET_OCID="ocid..."
```

The only other required environment variable is DEFAULT_METRICS value which is set to the location of the config file.

For Example:

```bash
export DEFAULT_METRICS="/msdataworkshop/observability/db-metrics-%EXPORTER_NAME%-exporter-metrics.toml"
```

Run using Java:

`java -jar target/observability-exporter-0.1.0.jar`

Run using Docker

`docker container run observability-exporter-0.1.0`

Run within Kubernetes:

See example yaml in examples directory

### Security and Other

The exporters are built on the Spring Boot framework and thereby inherit all of the capabilities present there, including

Enabling HTTPS: https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/1.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/configuration-security-enabling-https.html

Basic Auth: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authentication/passwords/basic.html

OAuth2 https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/

The reader is referred to this material to configure security and other aspects as appropriate.
